🧠 AI Text Summarization Tool — Documentation
📘 Project Title:
AI Text Summarization Tool Using Natural Language Processing

📌 Objective:
The aim of this project is to build a tool that can automatically summarize lengthy articles or documents using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The tool takes a long text as input and returns a concise, meaningful summary.

🔧 Tools & Technologies Used:
Component	Description
Language	Python 3.x
NLP Framework	Hugging Face transformers
Model	facebook/bart-large-cnn or t5-small
Libraries	transformers, torch, textwrap
Type	Abstractive Summarization (generates new phrases)

📥 Input:
Long paragraphs or full articles containing multiple sentences or paragraphs.

📄 Example Input:
Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. These systems can perform tasks such as speech recognition, decision-making, and visual perception. As AI technology advances, it continues to transform industries like healthcare, finance, and transportation.

📤 Output:
A short, coherent, and informative summary.

📋 Example Output:
Artificial Intelligence mimics human intelligence to perform tasks and is transforming various industries.

🧪 Python Script:

from transformers import pipeline

# Load summarizer pipeline with a pre-trained BART model
summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")

# Input text
input_text = """

# Generate summary
summary = summarizer(input_text, max_length=50, min_length=20, do_sample=False)

# Display the results
print("Original Text:\n", input_text)
print("\nSummary:\n", summary[0]['summary_text'])
⚙️ How It Works:
Model Loading: The BART model (facebook/bart-large-cnn) is loaded using Hugging Face's pipeline.

Input Parsing: The tool accepts a block of text from the user.

Summarization: The model processes the text and generates a shorter version.

Output Display: The summary is printed or returned to the user.

🟢 Features:
Generates abstractive summaries (not just sentence extraction).

Works on news articles, blogs, reports, or emails.

Easy-to-use with minimal setup.

⚠️ Limitations:
Requires internet access on first model load.

May not work well on highly technical or domain-specific content.

Some loss of nuance or detail in complex summaries.

💡 Future Enhancements:
GUI support using Tkinter or Streamlit.

Upload and summarize PDFs or web articles.

Support for multiple summarization models.

Integration with voice input and speech synthesis.
